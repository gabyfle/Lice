# Lice
Lice language interpreter.

## What is Lice ?

Lice is a toy programming language that is designed to complain to what I like in a programming language:

* Strong types
* Pattern matching
* A mix of C/Lua/OCaml syntaxes
* Recursivity
* Modularity and easy-to-use API to enhance the language and create libraries

At first, this language isn't designed to be used by programmers, but if you want to try it, feel free.

*Note: this is currently under construction, for the moment there is just a lexer and a parser*

## Roadmap

- Parser
    - Variable definitions (done)
    - Binary operators (done)
    - Blocks of code (done)
    - Recursive functions and returns (done)
    - Strong types in the language (done)
    - Strings (done)
    - Comments (done)
    - Maps (wip)
    - OCaml-like lists (done)
    - for-loops, while-loops (wip)
    - Pattern matching (todo)
